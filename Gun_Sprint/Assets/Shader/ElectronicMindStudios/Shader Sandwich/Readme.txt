Hi, welcome to Shader Sandwich! To get started I'd suggest taking a look at the online documentation here: http://electronic-mind.org/ShaderSandwichDocumentation/
You can find a bunch of getting started tutorials along with an in-depth reference, enjoy!

I've also included offline copies of the first 3 tutorials, they're in the Documentation folder. 
You can also find a demo scene in the Demo Scene folder :P, that shows off some of the example shaders :D

If you have any questions or problems, feel free to email me at:
Ztechnologies.com@gmail.com
Please read through/watch the beginner tutorials first though, I get a lot of questions that could be solved quicker by doing that :)

You can also report bugs or suggest features through the Help menu, in either Shader Sandwich (Help -> Report Bug or Suggest Feature!) or in the Unity Editor (Help -> Shader Sandwich -> Report Bug or Suggest Feature!).

Thanks, and have fun!

Regards,
	Sean Boettger
